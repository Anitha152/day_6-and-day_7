DAY_6 COOPER TRAINING 
-------------------------------------------------
1)Maximum Answer

Our friend Monk has an exam that has quite weird rules. Each question has a difficulty level in the form of an Integer. Now, Monk can only solve the problems that have difficulty level less than X . Now the rules are-
Score of the student is equal to the maximum number of answers he/she has attempted without skipping a question. Student is allowed to skip just "one" question that will not be counted in the continuity of the questions. Note- Assume the student knows the solution to the problem he/she attempts and always starts the paper from first question.
Given the number of Questions, N ,the maximum difficulty level of the problem Monk can solve , X ,and the difficulty level of each question , A[i] can you help him determine his maximum score?
Input Format
First Line contains Integer N , the number of questions and the maximum difficulty X Monk can solve. Next line contains N integers, A[i]denoting the difficulty level of each question.

Maximum score Monk can achieve in the exam.

Sample Input 0

7 6
4 3 7 6 7 2 2
Sample Output 0

3
Explanation 0

In this example, maximum difficulty = 6, Monk solves question 0 and 1, but skips the question 2 as A[2]>6. 
Monk then solves the question 3 , but stops at 4 because A[4]>6 and question 2 was already skipped. 
As 3 questions (0,1 and 3) were solved and 2 questions (2 and 4) have been skipped, therefore we print "3".

DAY_7 COOPER TRAINING
2)Find and Count Hashtags
Twitter shows trends in order to make its users aware of the trending news. 
These trends are nothing but trending hashtags that the users are tweeting about. 
For example: If thousands of users are talking about United States by adding a hashtag #US in their tweet, then US will be a trending hashtag. 
Couple of example tweets with hashtag #US could be:

Donald Trump becomes the 45th #US President Roger Federer wins #US Open for 5th time Given a list of N tweets, your task is to find top the five trending hashtags. Each tweet, let's call it S, will contain at least one one word with hashtag. 
There will be maximum of three hashtags in any tweet. All hashtags in a single tweet will be unique.
Note: 
1. Any tweet is composed of lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits and spaces. 
2. Any hashtag begins with # and the subsequent characters will only contain lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits.
First line of the input will contain N denoting the number of tweets. Next N lines, each will contain a string S.

Constraints
where S denotes length of string S i.e. length of tweet. Any hashtag denoted by H, where H denotes length of any hashtag H.

Output Format

Print the top five trending hashtags. In case of tie between any two hashtags, print them in lexicographical order in a new line.
